He loves it! He's obsessed with his belly button, so this is the perfect book for him. He's also obsessed with peek-a-boo, so he loves lifting the flaps. It was a definite hit!","title":"My son loves it"},{"date":"2016-04-28T21:00:00.000Z","author":"reviewer","link":"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/customer-reviews\/R1L8O7RM8DD6J3\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0689835604","rating":4,"id":"R1L8O7RM8DD6J3","text":"The book is sturdy and well made. My baby likes to carry her books around and they are routinely dropped. It has held up really well. She loves the flaps and finding the hands, feet, etc. My only critique is that the body parts that are highlighted are the smallest item on the whole page. As a visual representation for teaching a child it seems weird that the focal points are not scaled to be more familiarly identifiable.","title":"1 year old never tires of this flap book."},{"date":"2017-02-10T22:00:00.000Z","author":"Andrea Gates","link":"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/customer-reviews\/RGMH5ROASTBS8\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0689835604","rating":5,"id":"RGMH5ROASTBS8","text":"Well-made children's book that an child will love.","title":"Five Stars"},{"date":"2017-06-16T21:00:00.000Z","author":"Sjm","link":"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/customer-reviews\/RW6ORU2M3C461\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0689835604","rating":5,"id":"RW6ORU2M3C461","text":"I bought this book for a newborn.
