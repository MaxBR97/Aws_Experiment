Oh well, that's not the book's fault. Kids can be picky. He still likes the book, but it doesn't hold his attention all the way through the book (and it's very short). It's ok, but I wouldn't pay full price for it and glad I didn't.","rating":3,"author":"Priest","date":"2015-08-28T21:00:00.000Z"},{"id":"R2R3VHZOBOKHH3","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2R3VHZOBOKHH3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0689835604","title":"Cute book","text":"My 10 month old loves books where you lift flaps and this book is no exception.","rating":5,"author":"Kindle Customer","date":"2016-12-06T22:00:00.000Z"},{"id":"R20C15AL3RZNFK","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R20C15AL3RZNFK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0689835604","title":"I got it because it had so many great reviews.

But the pictures aren't real, so the body parts aren't realistic... the flaps are awkward... maybe i have to wait till he is older to appreciate it, but right now this isn't working for him.","rating":2,"author":"S.
