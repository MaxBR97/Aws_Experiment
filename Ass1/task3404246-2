However, my one year old likes to lift the flaps himself and I also think this is a great way for him to be part of the story too.  The problem with this book is the flaps covering the different body parts are very flimsy and very easily ruined.  Compared to some other books out there, this one doesn't live up to expectations.  Youngsters are still figuring out motor skills and are anything but delicate at this stage.  I appreciate books that are made to last more than a couple reads...","title":"Cute book but flimsy"},{"date":"2017-04-28T21:00:00.000Z","author":"Eileen M.","link":"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/customer-reviews\/R3DHV2T9Q991V7\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0689835604","rating":5,"id":"R3DHV2T9Q991V7","text":"Very cute!","title":"Five Stars"},{"date":"2016-02-09T22:00:00.000Z","author":"Tawn","link":"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/customer-reviews\/R3MRIY8FUDOYHU\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0689835604","rating":5,"id":"R3MRIY8FUDOYHU","text":"My almost 2 year old son loves the Katz books. We have the Beach Ball book, the Zoom Zoom book, and this one, so far, but I'm sure we'll get more.
