Each page asks, \"Where is baby's ...?\"  Toddlers delight in lifting the flaps to find the hidden pictures.  The pictures are bright and cute with eye-catching fabric and wallpaper patterns.  A very attractive book, and perfect for that stage when toddlers become fascinated with their belly buttons!  My 17 month old has really enjoyed this book.  It can be very helpful in getting kids to name body parts, and it's fun for both the baby and the parents to read.  Highly recommended.","title":"Great fun for baby and parents!"},{"date":"2016-08-08T21:00:00.000Z","author":"Frequent Shopper","link":"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/customer-reviews\/R1N41681HILU4W\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0689835604","rating":5,"id":"R1N41681HILU4W","text":"My one year old pulls this book out every day and loves lifting all the flaps.

Baby loves playing peek a boo with the flaps. It would be nice to have the flaps to be board book material vs paper so the baby doesn't tear them off in seconds trying to find a belly button. If you don't mind torn flaps, it's not a problem.","title":"Not 100% board book material"},{"date":"2016-04-24T21:00:00.000Z","author":"B","link":"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/customer-reviews\/R32KCC7AJYM6QS\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0689835604","rating":5,"id":"R32KCC7AJYM6QS","text":"This an adorable book.

She really enjoys turning the flaps and finding the items and then showing where the items (belly button etc.) are located on herself, her teddy bear, etc. Good value for money. She sometimes tear off a flap, and that is the only reason I do not give this item 5 stars, but the flaps are pretty easy to tape on again. This book is better than some other lift-the-flap books where it is hard for the infant to see where the flap is.","title":"Great book"},{"date":"2016-09-02T21:00:00.000Z","author":"Bobby Littrell","link":"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/customer-reviews\/R32FDZSX2MVDXV\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0689835604","rating":5,"id":"R32FDZSX2MVDXV","text":"My baby LOVES this book!
