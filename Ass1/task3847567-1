I bought it so he could have more lift the flap books as he seems to like them. He's 9 months old and will grab this book out for us to read. So I guess it's appealed to it's intended audience.","title":"The kid loves it"},{"date":"2016-01-18T22:00:00.000Z","author":"Tab","link":"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/customer-reviews\/R2KDDNCDQVLJBD\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0689835604","rating":5,"id":"R2KDDNCDQVLJBD","text":"So much fun to see my niece have fun lifting the flaps and finding baby's eyes, mouth, etc. I ordered six more books by this author the next day.","title":"So much fun to see my niece have fun lifting the flaps ..."},{"date":"2014-02-12T22:00:00.000Z","author":"Summer Shelton","link":"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/customer-reviews\/R1L72VD853B8CZ\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0689835604","rating":5,"id":"R1L72VD853B8CZ","text":"This flip book is sturdy and so much fun!

She doesn't seem to be too excited with lifting the flaps, which is strange because she likes to on other books.  I do think the illustrations are pretty sweet though.","title":"Doesn't capture interest"},{"date":"2015-03-29T21:00:00.000Z","author":"Kristi Geib","link":"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/customer-reviews\/R2XF37Q0BUEPWW\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0689835604","rating":4,"id":"R2XF37Q0BUEPWW","text":"Cute flap book.

However, the flaps are simply attached to the pages, rather than inverted into the pages, and are SUPER easy to rip off.  Sadly, this book vs. a toddler just isn't a fair fight!","title":"Great for teaching body parts, but not very sturdy"}],"title":"Where Is Baby's Belly Button? A Lift-the-Flap Book"}
